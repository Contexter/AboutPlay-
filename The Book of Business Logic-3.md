# What is OAuth2 and How to Implement It Quickly

OAuth2 is a widely adopted authorization framework that allows applications to secure access to resources without sharing user credentials. It's designed to provide consented access to a user's data on one service to another service, with the user's approval, thus enabling a more secure and controlled sharing mechanism.

## Implementing OAuth2 Quickly

1. **Setting up OAuth2 Client Credentials**: Register your application with an OAuth2 provider, like Google, to obtain client credentials (Client ID and Client Secret).

2. **Creating an OAuth2 Project**: Integrate these client credentials into your project using platforms or frameworks, such as FastAPI or Appwrite.

3. **Configuring Redirect URIs**: Specify where the OAuth2 provider should redirect users after authentication and authorization.

4. **Handling the Authorization Flow**: Implement the authorization flow, involving user redirection for authentication, receiving an authorization code, and exchanging this code for an access token.

5. **Securing Resource Access**: Use the obtained access token to make authorized requests on behalf of the user, ensuring secure storage and handling of tokens.
