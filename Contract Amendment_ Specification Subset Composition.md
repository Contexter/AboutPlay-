# Contract Amendment: Specification Subset Composition

Objective:
Enhance play!'s ability to accurately and efficiently generate specific subsets of API specifications, such as those provided for `restapi.benedikt-eickhoff.de`, directly from file-based knowledge without exceeding operational constraints.

Terms:

1. Clear Definition of Requirements:
   - Precise identification of the sections or models within the API specification that require subset generation.
   - Specification of the format and level of detail expected in the output.

2. Adaptation to Operational Constraints:
   - Acknowledgment of existing processing and output size constraints.
   - Agreement on a structured approach to subset generation that fits within these constraints, such as breaking down requests into smaller, manageable parts if necessary.

3. Provision of Detailed Instructions:
   - When direct generation or display of extensive subsets is not feasible, play! will provide detailed instructions or code snippets that enable the user to perform the required tasks in their local or external development environment.

4. Continuous Improvement:
   - Commitment to continuously improving play!'s capabilities in terms of processing efficiency and output management to better meet future subset generation requirements.

5. Feedback and Adjustment Mechanism:
   - Establishment of a feedback loop to regularly assess the effectiveness of the subset generation process and make adjustments as needed.

By incorporating this amendment into our contract, we aim to establish a clear framework for meeting your subset generation needs within the operational capabilities of this platform. This approach also provides flexibility to adapt as those capabilities evolve.
