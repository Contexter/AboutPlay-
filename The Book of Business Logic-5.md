# Implementing a Full-Stack OAuth2 Authentication Flow in FastAPI, Integrated with a Postgres Database

Implementing a full-stack OAuth2 authentication flow in FastAPI, integrated with a Postgres database, requires setting up a secure, real-world authentication system. This involves configuring FastAPI to handle OAuth2 authentication tokens, securely storing user credentials in Postgres, and protecting API routes based on user authentication status.

## Step 1: Database Setup
First, ensure the Postgres database has a users table with secure password storage. Use bcrypt or another secure hashing algorithm for passwords.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    hashed_password TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

## Step 2: FastAPI Security Configuration
Utilize FastAPI's security utilities to implement OAuth2 with Password (and Bearer with JWT tokens). This involves creating user models, token models, and utility functions for password hashing and verification.

## Step 3: Token Generation and Authentication
Implement JWT token generation for successful logins and token verification for protected routes. Use PyJWT or a similar library for JWT operations.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from jose import jwt
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key"
ALGORITHM = "HS256"

def create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: timedelta = None):
    to_encode = data.copy()
    expire = datetime.utcnow() + (expires_delta or timedelta(minutes=15))
    to_encode.update({"exp": expire})
    encoded_jwt = jwt.encode(to_encode, SECRET_KEY, algorithm=ALGORITHM)
    return encoded_jwt
```

## Step 4: User Authentication Endpoint
Create an endpoint for user authentication that verifies user credentials, generates a token for successful authentication, and returns it to the client.

## Step 5: Dependency for Current User
Create a dependency that extracts and validates the JWT token from requests, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints.

## Step 6: Frontend Integration
On the frontend, implement a login form that sends credentials to the FastAPI backend and stores the access token received. Ensure the frontend sends the token in the Authorization header for accessing protected routes.

## Step 7: Protecting Routes
Use the dependency created in Step 5 to protect routes, allowing only authenticated users access.

## OpenAPI Implementation Plan
Finally, document the entire authentication flow in the OpenAPI specification, including:

- The `/login` endpoint for user authentication.
- The security scheme used (OAuth2 with JWT tokens).
- Protected endpoints and how they utilize the security scheme.

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    bearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
security:
  - bearerAuth: []
paths:
  /login:
    post:
      summary: Authenticates user and returns an access token.
      ...
  /protected-route:
    get:
      summary: A protected route that requires authentication.
      security:
        - bearerAuth: []
      ...
```

This OpenAPI documentation will serve as a guide for developers and a contract ensuring the API's security mechanisms are transparent and standardized.

Implementing this full-stack OAuth2 authentication in FastAPI not only secures the application but also provides a clear, standardized method for handling user authentication and protecting sensitive data. It requires careful planning, implementation, and testing to ensure the security and functionality of the application.
