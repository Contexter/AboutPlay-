User Story:

**As a playwright** (fckfrg) **managing scripts within the Fountain database**, I want to efficiently track and update my script's metadata and author details, so I can maintain accurate records and make my work accessible to collaborators and the public.

**Scenario: Updating Script Details**

Given I have a script titled "The Polyxsupershow" in the Fountain database,
And I want to view and update its metadata and author details,
When I query the system for the script, author, and metadata details,
Then I should receive accurate information including the script title, URL, author name, biography, contact information, creation date, last modified date, version number, and additional information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. **View Script Details:**
   - The system should provide a way to view all details of a script, including its associated author and metadata.

2. **Update Metadata:**
   - As an author, I should be able to update the metadata of my script, including the last modified date and version number, to reflect the latest changes.

3. **Access Author Information:**
   - The system should allow access to the author's details, including name, biography, and contact information, ensuring transparency and communication channels for collaborative work.

4. **Ease of Use:**
   - The process of querying and updating script details should be straightforward, supporting a seamless workflow for authors and collaborators.
