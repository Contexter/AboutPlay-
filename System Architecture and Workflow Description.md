# System Architecture and Workflow Description:

1. Client:
- Role: Initiates HTTPS requests to access services provided by your application. The client can be a web browser, mobile app, or any other HTTP client.
- Interaction: Sends requests to Nginx, which acts as the entry point for these requests.

2. Nginx Reverse Proxy:
- Role: Serves as the front door for all incoming requests to the server. It handles SSL/TLS termination, which means it decrypts incoming HTTPS requests and forwards them as HTTP to the internal network (to the FastAPI application, in this case).
- Interaction: After decrypting requests, Nginx forwards them to the FastAPI application based on the configured routing rules. It also serves static files directly and can handle load balancing if multiple instances of the FastAPI application are running.

3. FastAPI Application:
- Role: Acts as a stateless proxy that processes requests from Nginx. It can perform additional logic such as authentication, request validation, and transformation before forwarding requests to PostgREST. FastAPI leverages the OpenAPI spec for documentation and client SDK generation.
- Interaction: Receives processed requests from Nginx, interacts with PostgREST by forwarding these requests, and receives responses from PostgREST to return back through Nginx to the client.

4. PostgREST:
- Role: Provides a RESTful API interface directly to the PostgreSQL database. It translates incoming HTTP requests into SQL queries and executes them against the database.
- Interaction: Receives forwarded requests from the FastAPI application, interacts with the PostgreSQL database to fetch or modify data, and sends the results back to the FastAPI application.

5. PostgreSQL Database:
- Role: Stores and manages all data for the application in a structured format. It includes various schemas, tables, and implements row-level security for fine-grained access control.
- Interaction: Processes SQL queries sent by PostgREST, returns query results back to PostgREST, which then propagates back up the chain to the client.

Flow of Work:
1. Request Initiation: A client sends an HTTPS request to access a specific resource or perform an action.
2. SSL/TLS Termination and Routing: Nginx decrypts the request and forwards it to the FastAPI application according to its routing configuration.
3. Request Processing: The FastAPI application processes the request, which may include authentication, validation, or other logic, before forwarding it to PostgREST.
4. Database Interaction: PostgREST translates the request into an SQL query, interacts with the PostgreSQL database, and retrieves or modifies data as requested.
5. Response Propagation: The response from the PostgreSQL database is sent back to the client through PostgREST, FastAPI, and Nginx, with each layer potentially adding additional processing or transformations.

This architecture enables a clean separation of concerns, leveraging the strengths of each component to create a secure, scalable, and maintainable application. Each part of the system is focused on its specific role, from managing client connections and encrypting data to processing business logic and managing database interactions.
