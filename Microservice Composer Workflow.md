# Microservice Composer Workflow

1. **Compose a Microservice-Specific OpenAPI Specification**
- Analyze the Full OpenAPI Spec: Start with the complete OpenAPI specification of your PostgREST server. This document describes all the endpoints and data models available through the server.
- Identify Relevant Endpoints: Determine which endpoints are relevant to the functionality of the microservice you intend to develop. Consider the operations that the microservice needs to perform and the data it needs to access or manipulate.
- Compose a Microservice-Specific OpenAPI Spec: Create a new OpenAPI specification document that only includes the endpoints and data models relevant to your microservice. This can involve deleting all sections unrelated to the microservice's intended functionality.

2. **Generate a Python Client with the Swagger Editor**
- Access the Swagger Editor: Use an online tool like the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to upload your microservice-specific OpenAPI specification.
- Generate the Python Client: Use the Swagger Editor's functionality to generate client code for Python. This will create a Python package that includes models and API clients corresponding to the endpoints defined in your OpenAPI spec.
- Download the Generated Client Code: Once the Python client code is generated, download it. This package will be used in your FastAPI application to interact with the PostgREST server.

3. **Upload and Configure the OpenAPI Client in the FastAPI App Development Repl**
- Create a New Repl for Your FastAPI Project: If you haven't already, create a new Repl on Replit.com, selecting Python as the language.
- Upload the Generated Client Code: Upload the downloaded Python client package to your Repl. You might need to use the Repl's Shell feature to unzip the package if it's archived.
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn: Ensure that FastAPI and Uvicorn (or another ASGI server) are listed as dependencies in your Repl's `pyproject.toml` file for package management.

4. **Implement the Generated Client Code into the FastAPI Routes**
- Import the Generated Client in Your FastAPI App: Modify your FastAPI application code (typically in `main.py`) to import the generated client package.
- Initialize the Client: Configure and initialize an instance of the generated client, setting any necessary parameters such as the API base URL.
- Use the Client in FastAPI Routes: In your FastAPI route handlers, use the methods provided by the generated client to perform API operations. Handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during API calls.

This workflow leverages the strengths of OpenAPI for API design, Swagger Codegen for client generation, and FastAPI for rapid API development, creating a powerful combination for microservice development.
