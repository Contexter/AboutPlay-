User requested assistance in generating an example CRUD proxy FastAPI application for a hypothetical "Movies" microservice, based on the structure and approach of the "Characters Management Microservice" as detailed in their file-based knowledge. The service is intended to interface with a server located at https://movies.benedikt-eickhoff.de. The request included the creation of Pydantic models and routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting movie entries, which would communicate with the backend server via HTTP requests.

Following this, the user inquired if routes from an existing OpenAPI specification could be used to generate the FastAPI proxy app, indicating a desire to provide detailed API routes for this purpose. They also suggested providing a .sql bootstrap script in conjunction with the paths as enough information to generate the proxy FastAPI app, showing a willingness to share database schema details and API paths to facilitate the app's creation.

The conversation highlights the user's interest in leveraging FastAPI for microservice development and their intent to engage in more actions soon, suggesting further collaboration and development tasks in the near future.
